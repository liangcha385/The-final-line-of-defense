  <p><i>An archaeological expedition doomed to fail, a man-made disaster that was planned in advance...</i></p>

The Final Line of Defense is a modpack based on Minecraft that leans towards a hardcore style, aiming to challenge players' ability to respond to increasingly powerful enemies.  
Players will take on the role of surviving members of an archaeological team, building shelters before the Sculk Ecosystem recovers and attempting to use their intelligence to contain the rapid expansion of the Sculk Ecosystem. Through day and night battles with the Sculk Ecosystem, they will gain knowledge and survive to investigate the truth at the source of the disaster
